\section*{Appendix A}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix A}
The appendices are not marked, or included in the word count.
They contain information not directly relevant to the main argument, for example raw data, a questionnaire, or a list of code. They are included as evidence of the work performed and to make it possible for a reader to replicate the study. If it is logical to divide up the Appendices, one convention is to give each a letter, but if you only have one Appendix that you do not need to add a letter.
For programs (for example), an appendix can be submitted on a storage medium such as a CD or DVD.
