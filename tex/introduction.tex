\chapter{Introduction}
Your introduction should motivate the research problem that you intend to solve in the dissertation\index{dissertation}. This chapter explains why the problem is important, and a brief overview of how the dissertation describes your solution to the problem.

\section{Background to the research}
You may require sections discussing why the general problem is interesting and important.

\section{Aims and objectives of the research project}
An overview (don’t go overboard with detail; that’s what the main chapters are for) of how you have chosen a specific research project to address the general problem that you have already described.

\section{Overview of the dissertation}
Sometimes it is helpful to put a kind of ‘roadmap’ to the dissertation here, if it helps the reader see how the different parts of the dissertation address different aspects of the research project. This is not essential, but can be useful.
