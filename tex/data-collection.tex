\chapter{Data Collection}
Depending on your research methods, you may not need a chapter on data collection. However, if your research relies on collecting empirical data, for example, or asking subjects to complete questionnaires, you may have found some interesting issues to report.

\section{Process and Data Sources}
You should describe how you chose your data sources, and the process by which you obtained your data.

\section{Preliminary Analysis}
You should describe any processes that you applied to the raw data before using it, and note any properties of the data that came to light during a preliminary inspection.
The raw data is often too voluminous to be included in the dissertation itself, but may be presented for inspection in an appendix. Note that appendices are not marked, and do not contribute to the word count.
